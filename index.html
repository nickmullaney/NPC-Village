                After falling in love with a local lady he was forced to leave his home city when the lord she was promised to found out.
                He traveled across the land taking odd jobs here and there until he grew tired of that life. 
                He hung up his cloak, bought his favorite watering hole and kept the place going so that everyone feels welcome. </p>
